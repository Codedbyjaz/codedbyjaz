# Hey, I'm Jazmin 👋

I’m a self-taught developer, mom, and creative—building from scratch with code, grit, and vision.

Right now, I’m:
- 🍼 Developing **Umbra** – a smart-home control hub for toddler parents
- 🍞 Building **Sourbuddy** – a voice-guided sourdough starter companion
- 🌐 Designing & coding my own **portfolio website** from the terminal up
- 🧠 Learning Firebase, JS, Python & backend tools day-by-day

I love creating tools for real people with real needs—especially ones that solve chaotic, everyday problems. I don’t just code to build—I code to **transform lives**.

---

### 🔧 Languages & Tools I’m Working With:
`JavaScript` `Firebase` `Python` `HTML` `CSS` `Replit` `Terminal`

---

### 🔍 What I’m Looking For:
- Freelance or collaborative opportunities
- Bounties that challenge me and grow my skills
- Real people who want real apps built, beautifully

---

### 🌱 Fun fact:
I’m learning to turn my life story into a TV series and I once built an entire toddler tech system just to make parenting smoother 😅
