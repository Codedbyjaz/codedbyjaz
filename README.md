Hey, I'm Jazmin 👋
💻 Self-Taught Dev • 👩‍👦 Full-Time Mom • 🛠 Creative Visionary

I'm a developer, designer, and problem-solver who's building bold, human-first tech from scratch—with no shortcuts, no middlemen, and no fluff.

Everything I create is inspired by real-life needs—from creative entrepreneurs to overstretched parents. I build tools that calm the chaos, spark clarity, and feel good to use. ✨

🧠 What I’m Working On
UmbraTech – My own growing tech brand 🌑
I’m developing digital systems and tools designed to simplify and elevate everyday experiences. This includes several private projects (gear systems, smart integrations, and automation tools), all built under the Umbra umbrella.

Portfolio Website – Hand-coded, terminal-built, and designed to showcase both beauty and functionality.

Personal App Suite – From client-facing portals to productivity tools, I’ve launched and deployed multiple working apps, including:
InsightCoach
DevSyncMaster
Shoop
PhotoPortfolioHub
BizGlowOptimizer
ParentalHub
IQCoach
FormFlow

🌱 Fun Fact
I’m coding my way through motherhood, healing, and growth—and turning my real-life story into something powerful. One repo at a time.

is this a read me format 


ChatGPT said:
Yes! The version I just gave you works perfectly as a README.md file for your GitHub or Replit profile/project.

It’s written in Markdown format, which is what README.md files use to display styled text (like headers, bullets, and links) on platforms like:

GitHub

Replit

GitLab

Your own portfolio site (if you ever build it with a Markdown renderer)
